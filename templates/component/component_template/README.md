## Order and Naming
Component templates can not be given a true priority/order and are solely based on the order of the list when used within the index_template under the setting "copmposed_of".

In order to ensure that the component templates are applied in the correct order, the component templates are listed in the order that they should be applied alphanumerically.

Thus it is required that the component templates are prefixed with a number to ensure that they are applied in the correct order.

However, the prefixed number is not used in the actual name of the component template and is only used for ordering purposes.

This is because when viewing these within your Elastic cluster the number prefix will be confusing and not provide value.
